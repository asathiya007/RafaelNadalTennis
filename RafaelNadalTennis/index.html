                    Akshay Sathiya in honor of his favorite tennis player, Rafael Nadal,
                    who is one of his biggest role models and sources of
                    inspiration/motivation.

                <p>
                    Rafael Nadal is regarded as one of the greatest tennis players
                    in the history of the sport. As of the time of this writing,
                    he has won a whopping 17 Grand Slam titles,
                    33 Masters titles, and the Olympic gold medal in both singles
                    and doubles. However, it is not only his accomplishments that make him great,
                    but his perseverance and resilience on and off the court as well.
                    His grit has helped him grow as both a person and a player, and it is
                    why he stands tall as a figure of inspiration and a source of motivation
                    for millions around the globe.
